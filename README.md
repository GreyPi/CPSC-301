# CPSC-301
//This program takes the numbers in the array and displays them in reverse order.
//The void function passes an int array called number and the size of the array called length
//I use a forloop and intialize "i" to the size of the array and then count decrement the array until it hits zero.
//(Important note having i >= 0, the equal too is very imporantant)
